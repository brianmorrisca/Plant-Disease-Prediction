# Plant-Disease-Prediction

### Introduction

The major risk to food safety is Plant diseases and now it has become important practice to identity plant diseases in the starting phase itself to minimize the crop and financial losses. To overcome this challenge a state of the art Convolution Neural Network is proposed to classify tomato leaf diseases with the help of computer vision.
